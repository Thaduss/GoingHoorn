                            <p>
                                Hoorn was created in the 12th century as a village at the zuiderzee. The area was typical for the Netherlands and was swampy, But because of inpolderingen the land could be used to build on. The village came to be because of its trade position. Hoorn got its city rights around the year 1357, wich was posible because of economic development of the trade of fish.

                                The 16th and 17th century Hoorn became even bigger and richer than ever, this came to be because it became a center for the the Verenigde Oost-Indische Compagnie and thus was important place for the worldwide trading. Many famous sailors such as Jan Pieterszoon Coen came from Hoorn. The city was rich and the buildings, such as the Statenlogement and the Hoofdtoren, still reflect this.

                            <p>
                                After the Golden Age, Hoorn's trade began to stagnate, mainly due to the rise of larger ports such as Amsterdam. The city could no longer keep up with the competition and lost its leading position in international trade. This led to a prolonged period of economic decline.

                            <p>
                                The 19th century brought new infrastructure to Hoorn with the construction of railways and improved roads. This led to a gradual economic revival. Fishing and agriculture became more important, although the city never regained its former position as a trading center. In the 20th century, Hoorn turned into a commuter city due to the growth of Amsterdam.
